              George W. Campbell (1769â€“1848) was an American statesman who served as a U.S. Representative, Senator, Tennessee Supreme Court Justice, and U.S. Ambassador to Russia. Appointed fifth United States Secretary of the Treasury by James Madison, he faced national financial disorder brought on by the War of 1812. Campbell was unsuccessful in his efforts to raise enough money through government bond sales and he resigned after only eight months in office, disillusioned and in bad health.
